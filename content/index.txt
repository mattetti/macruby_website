In the course of solving these problems, MacRuby has also solved numerous problems in the original implementation of Ruby. Consequently, there are a number of reasons (e.g. convenience, efficiency, flexibility, performance) why one might wish to use MacRuby for new (and ongoing) Ruby applications... <a href="/documentation/why-macruby.html"><br/><i>Read more...</i></a></p>

<strong>MacRuby</strong> is an implementation of Ruby 1.9 directly on top of Mac OS X core technologies such as the Objective-C runtime and garbage collector, the LLVM compiler infrastructure and the Foundation and ICU frameworks. It is the goal of MacRuby to enable the creation of full-fledged Mac OS X applications which do not sacrifice performance in order to enjoy the benefits of using Ruby. <a href="/documentation/overview.html"><i>Read more...</i></a>
